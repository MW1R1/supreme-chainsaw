This repo contains 3 programs that perform 3 different functions
1. grade generator.js is a program that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 then outputs the correct grade.
2. detector.js is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
3. salarycalculator.js is a program that calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary given the basic salary and benefits of an employee.
